# Automatic PDF Formatting Review Feature

## Overview

The scientific writer now includes an **automatic PDF formatting review subagent** that visually inspects every generated PDF and iteratively improves formatting quality.

## How It Works

### Automatic Trigger
- **Activates automatically** after every LaTeX compilation
- No user input required - fully integrated into the workflow
- Works for all document types: papers, posters, manuscripts

### Visual Inspection
The subagent reads the entire PDF and checks for:

1. **Text Overlaps** - Text overlapping with figures, tables, equations, or margins
2. **Phantom Spaces** - Excessive whitespace, awkward gaps between sections
3. **Figure Placement** - Figures appearing far from references or overlapping text
4. **Table Issues** - Tables extending beyond margins, poor alignment
5. **Section Breaks** - Inconsistent spacing, awkward page breaks
6. **Margins** - Text/figures bleeding into margins
7. **Page Breaks** - Sections starting at bottom of page, widows/orphans
8. **Caption Spacing** - Improper spacing around figure/table captions
9. **Bibliography** - Reference list formatting and spacing issues
10. **Equation Spacing** - Equations overlapping text or poorly positioned

### Iterative Fix Process

1. **Initial Review** - PDF is read and analyzed for all formatting issues
2. **Report Findings** - Specific problems are identified with page numbers
3. **Apply Fixes** - LaTeX code is modified with specific solutions:
   - Text overlaps → `\vspace{}`, `\FloatBarrier`
   - Phantom spaces → Remove excessive spacing, adjust section parameters
   - Figure placement → `[htbp]`, `[H]`, `\FloatBarrier` before sections
   - Table issues → `tabularx`, column width adjustments, scaling
   - Page breaks → `\clearpage`, `\newpage`, spacing adjustments
   - Captions → `\captionsetup` spacing parameters
   - Bibliography → biblatex/natbib settings fixes
4. **Recompile** - PDF is regenerated with fixes applied
5. **Review Again** - Process repeats for up to 3 iterations
6. **Completion** - Stops when no issues found or max iterations reached

### Example Output

```
[14:51:25] PDF REVIEW: Starting automatic formatting inspection
[14:51:30] PDF REVIEW: Analyzing 8 pages for formatting issues
[14:51:50] PDF REVIEW: Found 2 formatting issues
[14:51:51] PDF REVIEW: Issue 1 - Page 4: Figure 1 has excessive space below caption
[14:51:52] PDF REVIEW: Issue 2 - Page 6: Results section header orphaned at bottom
[14:51:55] PDF REVIEW: Applying fixes...
[14:52:00] PDF REVIEW: Fixed figure spacing on page 4 - adjusted \abovecaptionskip
[14:52:05] PDF REVIEW: Fixed page break on page 6 - added \needspace{4\baselineskip}
[14:52:10] PDF REVIEW: Recompiling PDF with formatting fixes
[14:52:30] PDF REVIEW: Iteration 2 - Analyzing updated PDF
[14:52:45] PDF REVIEW: ✅ No formatting issues detected - PDF looks excellent!
[14:52:46] PDF REVIEW: Completed 2 formatting improvement iterations
```

## Integration Points

### In `claude.md` System Instructions

**Section 5: AUTOMATIC PDF Formatting Review** (after LaTeX compilation)
- Mandatory step after every PDF generation
- Detailed focus areas and review process
- Specific LaTeX fixes for common issues
- Iteration limit and logging requirements

**Logging Requirements Updated:**
- PDF formatting review events logged
- Issues found and fixes applied tracked
- Progress.md updated with formatting quality assessment

**Example Timeline Updated:**
- PDF review integrated into example workflow
- Shows realistic multi-iteration improvement cycle

**Quality Assurance Mention:**
- Core mission statement updated to highlight automatic PDF review

## Benefits

✅ **Professional Output** - Eliminates common LaTeX formatting issues
✅ **No User Intervention** - Completely automatic
✅ **Iterative Improvement** - Multiple passes ensure quality
✅ **Specific Fixes** - Provides exact LaTeX solutions, not vague suggestions
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage** - Checks all aspects of PDF layout
✅ **Logged Progress** - All issues and fixes documented in progress.md

## Configuration

- **Max Iterations**: 3 (configurable in system instructions)
- **Trigger**: Automatic after any successful PDF compilation
- **Scope**: All PDFs (papers, posters, manuscripts, etc.)

## Technical Details

The feature is implemented entirely through system instructions in `claude.md`:
- No code changes required in `scientific_writer.py`
- Agent automatically follows the review protocol
- Uses existing Read tool to analyze PDFs
- Uses existing Edit tool to fix LaTeX source
- Uses existing Bash tool to recompile PDFs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Configurable iteration limit per user preference
- More granular control over specific formatting checks
- Template-specific formatting rules (NeurIPS, Nature, IEEE, etc.)
- Export formatting review report separately
