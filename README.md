A Python package and CLI for generating publication-ready scientific papers, reports, posters, grant proposals, and more academic documents with Claude Sonnet and Perplexity models. Version 2.0 adds a fully typed, programmatic API while keeping the CLI 100% backward compatible.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.12
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required), OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional for research lookup)

### Install

#### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install scientific-writer
```

#### Option 2: Install from source with uv
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-scientific-writer.git
cd claude-scientific-writer
uv sync
```

### Configure API keys
```bash
# .env file (recommended)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key" >> .env
# or export in your shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_key'
```

### Use the CLI
```bash
# If installed via pip
scientific-writer

# If installed from source with uv
uv run scientific-writer
```

### Use the Python API
```python
import asyncio
from scientific_writer import generate_paper

async def main():
    async for update in generate_paper("Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing"):
        if update["type"] == "progress":
            print(f"[{update['percentage']}%] {update['message']}")
        else:
            print(f"PDF: {update['files']['pdf_final']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Features
- Generate scientific papers, reports, posters, grant proposals, and other academic documents with LaTeX and BibTeX
- Format and iteratively edit existing drafts with intelligent revision capabilities
- Real-time progress streaming and transparent logging
- Automatic bibliography and citation management
- Data and figure integration from a local data/ folder
- Research lookup via OpenRouter (optional)
- CLI and programmatic API with full type hints

## Typical Workflow
1. Place figures and data in data/ at the project root (images -> figures/, files -> data/ automatically).
2. Run the CLI (or use the API) and describe what you want (venue, topic, constraints).
3. Follow progress updates; outputs are saved under paper_outputs/<timestamp>_<topic>/.

## Versioning and Publishing (short)
Use `uv` and the helper scripts:
- Bump version (keeps pyproject + __init__ in sync): `uv run scripts/bump_version.py [patch|minor|major]`
- Build and publish: `uv run scripts/publish.py` (or `--bump patch|minor|major`)
See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for prerequisites, dry runs, tagging, and verification.

## Migration (v1.x -> v2.0)
- CLI remains unchanged (scientific-writer).
- New programmatic API: from scientific_writer import generate_paper.
- Legacy single-file script is replaced by a proper package; no action needed for CLI users.
