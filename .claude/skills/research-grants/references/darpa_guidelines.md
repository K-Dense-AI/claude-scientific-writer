# DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Grant Writing Guidelines

## Agency Overview

**Mission**: Make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security

**Tagline**: "Creating breakthrough technologies and capabilities for national security"

**Annual Budget**: ~$4 billion

**Website**: https://www.darpa.mil

**Key Characteristics**:
- High-risk, high-reward research
- Focused on revolutionary breakthroughs, not incremental advances
- Technology transition to military and commercial applications
- Program managers with broad autonomy

## How DARPA Works

### Program Manager-Centric Model

**Program Managers (PMs)**:
- ~100 PMs across DARPA
- Hired on 3-5 year rotations from academia, industry, government labs
- Have significant autonomy to create and run programs
- Identify "DARPA-hard" problems and solutions
- Manage portfolios of 10-20 projects

**PM Lifecycle**:
1. **Develop vision**: Identify transformative opportunity
2. **Create program**: Design research thrusts and metrics
3. **Issue BAA**: Broad Agency Announcement for proposals
4. **Select teams**: Choose performers and structure program
5. **Manage program**: Track milestones, adjust course, transition technology
6. **Transition**: Hand off successful technologies to services or industry

**Implication for Proposers**: 
- PMs have the vision—your job is to execute it
- Contact PM before proposing (almost always required)
- Understand PM's technical vision and goals
- Build relationship with PM (within ethical bounds)

### The "DARPA-Hard" Test

**Three Questions Every DARPA Program Must Answer**:

1. **What are you trying to do?**
   - Articulate objectives using absolutely no jargon
   - Clear, specific technical goal

2. **How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
   - What's the current state of the art?
   - Why are current approaches insufficient?
   - What fundamental barriers exist?

3. **What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?**
   - What's the breakthrough insight or capability?
   - Why hasn't this been done before?
   - What's changed to make it possible now?

**Additional Considerations**:
- **Who cares?** (What's the national security impact?)
- **What if you're right?** (What becomes possible?)
- **What if you're wrong?** (Is the risk acceptable?)
- **What if you succeed?** (Is there a transition path?)

**DARPA Seeks**:
- **High Risk**: 50% chance of failure is acceptable
- **High Reward**: 10x improvement, not 10% improvement
- **Measurable**: Clear metrics of success
- **Transitional**: Path to operational use or commercial adoption

## Types of DARPA Solicitations

### 1. Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs)

**Most Common Mechanism**: Open solicitations for specific program areas

**Characteristics**:
- Issued by program managers for specific programs
- Describe technical objectives and research thrusts
- Multiple submission deadlines or rolling submission
- Full proposals typically 20-40 pages
- Often require abstract or white paper first

**Types of BAAs**:

**Program BAAs**: For specific named programs
- Clear technical objectives and metrics
- Defined research areas (thrusts)
- Specified deliverables and milestones
- Known PM with clear vision

**Office-Wide BAAs**: General solicitations by technical office
- Broader scope, less prescriptive
- Looking for transformative ideas
- More flexibility in approach
- May have multiple areas of interest

### 2. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)

**For Small Businesses**: 
- **Phase I**: $150K-$250K, 6-9 months (feasibility)
- **Phase II**: $1M-$2M, 2 years (development)
- **Phase III**: Non-SBIR funds (commercialization)

### 3. Proposers Days and Special Notices

**Proposers Day**: Pre-solicitation event
- PM presents program vision and objectives
- Q&A with potential proposers
- Networking for team formation
- Often required or strongly encouraged to attend

**Special Notices**: Requests for Information (RFIs), teaming opportunities

### The "Heilmeier Catechism"

**DARPA uses this set of questions** (created by former DARPA director George Heilmeier):

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
5. What are the risks?
6. How much will it cost?
7. How long will it take?
8. What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?

**Your proposal should clearly answer all eight questions.**

## DARPA Proposing Strategy

### Before Writing

**1. Contact the Program Manager**
- Email PM to introduce yourself and idea
- Request call to discuss fit with program
- Attend Proposers Day if available
- Ask clarifying questions about BAA

**2. Form a Strong Team**
- DARPA values multidisciplinary teams
- Include complementary expertise
- Mix of academia, industry, government labs
- Clearly defined roles
- Prior collaboration history (if possible)

**3. Understand the Vision**
- What is the PM trying to achieve?
- What technical barriers need to be overcome?
- What does success look like?
- What are the program metrics?

**4. Identify Transition Path**
- Who will use the technology?
- What's the path from prototype to product?
- Who are potential transition partners?
- What's the market or operational need?

### Writing the Proposal

**Lead with Impact**:
- Open with the "so what?"
- National security or economic impact
- What becomes possible if you succeed?

**Be Concrete and Specific**:
- Clear technical objectives with metrics
- Measurable milestones
- Quantitative targets (10x improvement, not "better")
- Specific deliverables

**Demonstrate Innovation**:
- What's the breakthrough?
- Why hasn't this been done before?
- What's changed to make it possible now?
- How is this different from evolutionary approaches?

**Address Risk Head-On**:
- Identify technical risks explicitly
- Explain mitigation strategies
- Show that you've thought through failure modes
- DARPA expects risk—don't hide it, manage it

**Show You Can Execute**:
- Detailed project plan with milestones
- Team with relevant track record
- Realistic schedule and budget
- Go/no-go decision points
- Management approach for complex programs

**Emphasize Transition**:
- Who will use the results?
- Path to operationalization or commercialization
- Engagement with potential users during program
- IP strategy that enables transition

### Common Mistakes

1. **Incremental Research**: Proposing 10% improvement instead of 10x
2. **Academic Focus**: Pure research without application focus
3. **No Transition Plan**: No pathway to use or commercialization
4. **Ignoring PM Vision**: Not aligned with program objectives
5. **Vague Metrics**: "Improve" or "enhance" instead of quantitative targets
6. **Underestimating Risk**: Claiming low risk (DARPA wants high risk, high reward)
7. **Weak Team**: Insufficient expertise or poorly defined roles
8. **No Differentiation**: Similar to existing efforts without clear advantage
9. **Ignoring BAA**: Not following proposal format or requirements
10. **Late Contact with PM**: Waiting until proposal due date to engage

**Key Takeaway**: DARPA seeks revolutionary breakthroughs that advance national security, not incremental research. Successful proposals articulate clear, measurable objectives (answering "what if true?"), demonstrate innovative approaches to "DARPA-hard" problems, include strong multidisciplinary teams, proactively address technical risks, and provide realistic paths to transition. Early engagement with the Program Manager is essential—DARPA is a PM-driven agency where understanding the vision is critical to success.
