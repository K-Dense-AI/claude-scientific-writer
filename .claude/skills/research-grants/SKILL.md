# Research Grant Writing

## Overview

Research grant writing is the process of developing competitive funding proposals for federal agencies and foundations. Master agency-specific requirements, review criteria, narrative structure, budget preparation, and compliance for NSF (National Science Foundation), NIH (National Institutes of Health), DOE (Department of Energy), and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) submissions.

**Critical Principle: Grants are persuasive documents that must simultaneously demonstrate scientific rigor, innovation, feasibility, and broader impact.** Each agency has distinct priorities, review criteria, formatting requirements, and strategic goals that must be addressed.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Writing research proposals for NSF, NIH, DOE, or DARPA programs
- Preparing project descriptions, specific aims, or technical narratives
- Developing broader impacts or significance statements
- Creating research timelines and milestone plans
- Preparing budget justifications and personnel allocation plans
- Responding to program solicitations or funding announcements
- Addressing reviewer comments in resubmissions
- Planning multi-institutional collaborative proposals
- Writing preliminary data or feasibility sections
- Preparing biosketches, CVs, or facilities descriptions

- Show that success will have significant impact

**Structure of Persuasion**:
1. **Hook**: Capture attention with significance
2. **Problem**: Establish what's not known or not working
3. **Solution**: Present your innovative approach
4. **Evidence**: Support with preliminary data
5. **Impact**: Show transformative potential
6. **Team**: Demonstrate capability to deliver

**Language Choices**:

- Demonstrate expertise to handle challenges
- Include contingency plans

**Common Concerns**:
- Too ambitious for timeline/budget
- Technically infeasible
- Team lacks necessary expertise
- Preliminary data insufficient
- Methods not adequately described
- Lack of innovation or significance

### Integration and Coherence

**Ensure All Parts Align**:
- Budget supports activities in project description
- Timeline matches aims and milestones
- Team composition matches required expertise
- Broader impacts connect to research plan
- Letters of support confirm stated collaborations

**Avoid Contradictions**:
- Preliminary data vs. stated gaps
- Claimed expertise vs. publication record

## Resubmission Strategies

### NIH Resubmission (A1)

**Introduction to Resubmission** (1 page):
- Summarize major criticisms from previous review
- Describe specific changes made in response
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Be respectful of reviewers' comments
- Highlight substantial improvements

**Strategies**:
- Address every major criticism
- Make changes visible (but don't use track changes in final)
- Strengthen weak areas (preliminary data, methods, significance)
- Consider changing aims if fundamentally flawed
- Get external feedback before resubmitting
- Use full 37-month window if needed for new data

**When Not to Resubmit**:
- Fundamental conceptual flaws
- Lack of innovation or significance
- Missing key expertise or resources
- Extensive revisions needed (consider new submission)

### NSF Resubmission

**NSF allows resubmission after revision**:
- Address reviewer concerns in revised proposal
- No formal "introduction to resubmission" section
- May be reviewed by same or different panel
- Consider program officer feedback
- May need to wait for next submission cycle

For detailed resubmission guidance, refer to `references/resubmission_strategies.md`.
