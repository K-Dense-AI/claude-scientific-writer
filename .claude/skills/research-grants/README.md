# Research Grants Skill

## Overview

Comprehensive skill for writing competitive research grant proposals focused on four major U.S. funding agencies:
- **NSF** (National Science Foundation)
- **NIH** (National Institutes of Health)
- **DOE** (Department of Energy)
- **DARPA** (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)

## What This Skill Provides

### Agency-Specific Guidance

Detailed reference materials for each funding agency including:
- Mission and priorities
- Review criteria and scoring
- Proposal structure and page limits
- Budget requirements
- Submission processes
- Tips for competitive applications

### Core Components

- **Specific Aims Pages** (NIH): Template and detailed guide for the critical 1-page aims page
- **Project Summaries** (NSF): Template for the required Overview, Intellectual Merit, and Broader Impacts
- **Broader Impacts**: Comprehensive strategies for NSF's equally-weighted review criterion
- **Budget Justification**: Templates and examples for personnel, equipment, travel, and supplies
- **Review Criteria**: Understanding what reviewers look for at each agency

### Templates

Ready-to-use templates for:
- NSF Project Summary
- NIH Specific Aims Page
- Budget Justifications
- (Additional templates in development)

## How to Use This Skill

### Quick Start

When writing a grant proposal, specify the agency and grant type:

```
> Help me write an NSF proposal for computational biology research
> I need to draft NIH R01 Specific Aims for my cancer research project
> What should I include in a DOE ARPA-E concept paper?
> I'm applying for a DARPA program - help me structure the proposal
```

### Detailed Guidance

For in-depth help on specific components:

```
> Help me write compelling broader impacts for my NSF proposal
> Review my NIH Specific Aims page
> What should I include in my budget justification?
> How do I respond to reviewer comments in an NIH resubmission?
```

### Agency Comparison

```
> What are the key differences between NSF and NIH proposals?
> Should I apply to DOE or DARPA for my energy technology project?
```

## Key Features

### NSF Proposals

- **Intellectual Merit + Broader Impacts** (equally weighted)
- Strategies for substantive, measurable broader impacts

### DARPA Proposals

- **DARPA-hard problems**: High-risk, high-reward
- **Heilmeier Catechism**: The 8 critical questions
- Program Manager engagement (critical!)
- Phase-based structure with milestones
- Technology transition planning
- Demonstration and prototypes

## Success Metrics

Typical success rates by agency:

- **NIH R01**: ~20% overall (~27% for Early Stage Investigators)
- **DOE Office of Science**: 20-40% (varies by program)
- **ARPA-E**: 2-5% (concept papers to awards)
- **DARPA**: Highly variable by program

## Common Use Cases

### First-Time Applicants
```
> I've never written a grant before. Help me understand NSF proposal structure.
> What are the most common mistakes in first NIH R01 applications?
```

### Experienced Investigators
```
> Help me strengthen the innovation section for my NIH resubmission
> I need to address broader impacts more substantively for NSF
> What's the best way to show technology transition for DARPA?
```

### Career Development
```
> Help me write a competitive NSF CAREER proposal
> What should I emphasize in an NIH K99/R00 application?
```

### Multi-Agency Strategy
```
> Should I submit this to NSF or NIH?
> Can I submit similar proposals to DOE and DARPA?
```

## Best Practices

### Start Early
- NSF/NIH proposals: Start 3-6 months before deadline
- DOE/DARPA proposals: 4-6 months (especially if involving national labs)

### Get Feedback
- Mock review sessions
- Colleagues in and outside your field
- Institutional grant support offices
- Program officers (when appropriate)

### Understand Review Criteria
- NSF: Intellectual Merit + Broader Impacts (equal weight)
- NIH: Significance, Investigator, Innovation, Approach, Environment (scored 1-9)
- DOE: Technical merit, qualifications, budget, relevance
- DARPA: Innovation, impact, team, feasibility, transition

### Common Success Factors

âœ… Clear, compelling significance and innovation
âœ… Strong preliminary data (NIH, DOE)
âœ… Detailed, rigorous methodology
âœ… Realistic timeline and budget
âœ… Specific, measurable outcomes
âœ… Strong team with relevant expertise
âœ… Integration of broader impacts (NSF)
âœ… Technology transition plan (DOE, DARPA)

## Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### For NSF Proposals
1. Start with Specific Aims/Objectives (even though not required)
2. Develop broader impacts with same rigor as research plan
3. Use figures and diagrams liberally (make it skimmable)
4. Address both review criteria explicitly
5. Get feedback from outside your immediate field

### For NIH Proposals
1. Perfect your Specific Aims page first (10+ drafts)
2. Include substantial preliminary data
3. Address rigor and reproducibility explicitly
4. Identify potential problems proactively with alternatives
5. Make sure your aims are independent but synergistic

### For DOE Proposals
1. Emphasize energy relevance and impact
2. Include quantitative metrics (cost, efficiency, emissions)
3. Develop pathway to deployment or commercialization
4. Consider national laboratory partnerships
5. Address technology readiness levels

### For DARPA Proposals
1. Contact the Program Manager early (essential!)
2. Attend Proposers Day events
3. Focus on breakthrough innovation (10x, not 10%)
4. Answer the Heilmeier Catechism explicitly
5. Develop clear transition strategy

**Remember**: Grant writing is both an art and a science. This skill provides the frameworks, strategies, and best practicesâ€”but your unique research vision, preliminary data, and team expertise are what will ultimately win funding. Start early, seek feedback, revise extensively, and don't be discouraged by rejection. Even the most successful scientists face many declined proposals before achieving funding success.

Good luck with your proposals! ðŸŽ¯
