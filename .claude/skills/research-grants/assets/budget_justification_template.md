# Budget Justification Template

## Overview

A budget justification provides detailed explanation for each budget line item, demonstrating that costs are necessary, reasonable, and directly related to the proposed research. The justification should be detailed enough for reviewers to understand and assess cost reasonableness.

**Key Principles**:
- Justify EVERY line item in terms of the research plan
- Explain calculations clearly
- Show that costs are necessary for the proposed work
- Demonstrate cost-effectiveness where possible
- Follow agency-specific formats and requirements

This rate covers facilities costs (building depreciation, utilities, operations and maintenance) and administrative costs (sponsored projects administration, accounting, library, general administration). 

*Calculation example (Year 1)*:
- Total direct costs: $550,000
- Less: Equipment ($425,000), participant support ($65,000), consortium F&A ($8,000)
- MTDC base: $52,000

## Tips for Strong Budget Justifications

✅ **Do**:
- Tie every cost directly to specific aims and activities
- Provide detailed calculations showing your work
- Explain why the amount is necessary and reasonable
- Use institutional or national standards for rates
- Show cost-effectiveness where possible
- Include escalation (inflation) for out-years
- Be specific about equipment models, conference names, etc.

❌ **Don't**:
- Use vague language ("miscellaneous supplies")
- Forget to justify every line item
- Over-budget for contingency
- Include costs unrelated to the proposed work
- Underestimate costs (creates problems if funded)
- Forget agency-specific cost limitations (salary caps, F&A exclusions)

## Agency-Specific Notes

**NIH**: 
- Salary cap applies (~$221,900 for 2024)
- Modular budgets (≤$250K direct) require less detail
- Participant support costs excluded from F&A

**NSF**:
- No salary cap
- Generally 2 summer months maximum for 9-month faculty
- Cost sharing not required (except specific programs)

**DOE**:
- Often requires detailed budgets by quarter
- May require cost sharing
- Equipment often requires special justification

**DARPA**:
- Detailed costs by phase and task
- Often requires supporting cost data
- May need rates approved (DCAA audit for industry)
