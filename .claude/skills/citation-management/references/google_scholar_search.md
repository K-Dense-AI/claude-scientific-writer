## Advanced Search Operators

### Author Search

Find papers by specific authors:

```
author:LeCun
author:"Geoffrey Hinton"
author:Church synthetic biology
```

**Variations**:
- Single last name: `author:Smith`
- Full name in quotes: `author:"Jane Smith"`
- Author + topic: `author:Doudna CRISPR`

**Tips**:
- Authors may publish under different name variations
- Try with and without middle initials
- Consider name changes (marriage, etc.)
- Use quotation marks for full names

### Title Search

Search only in article titles:

```
intitle:transformer
intitle:"attention mechanism"
intitle:review climate change
```

**Use cases**:
- Finding papers specifically about a topic
- More precise than full-text search
- Reduces irrelevant results
- Good for finding reviews or methods

### Source (Journal) Search

Search within specific journals or conferences:

```
source:Nature
source:"Nature Communications"
source:NeurIPS
source:"Journal of Machine Learning Research"
```

**Applications**:

- Find papers in specialized journals
- Identify conference-specific work
- Verify publication venue

### Exclusion Operator

Exclude terms from results:

```
machine learning -survey
CRISPR -patent
climate change -news
deep learning -tutorial -review
```

**Common exclusions**:
- `-survey`: Exclude survey papers
- `-review`: Exclude review articles
- `-patent`: Exclude patents
- `-book`: Exclude books
- `-news`: Exclude news articles
- `-tutorial`: Exclude tutorials

### OR Operator

Search for papers containing any of multiple terms:

```
"machine learning" OR "deep learning"
CRISPR OR "gene editing"
"climate change" OR "global warming"
```

**Best practices**:
- OR must be uppercase
- Combine synonyms
- Include acronyms and spelled-out versions
- Use with exact phrases

### Wildcard Search

Use asterisk (*) as wildcard for unknown words:

```
"machine * learning"
"CRISPR * editing"
"* neural network"
```

**Note**: Limited wildcard support in Google Scholar compared to other databases.

## Advanced Filtering

### Year Range

Filter by publication year:

**Using interface**:
- Click "Since [year]" on left sidebar
- Select custom range

**Using search operators**:
```
# Not directly in search query
# Use interface or URL parameters
```

**In script**:
```bash
python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "quantum computing" \
  --year-start 2020 \
  --year-end 2024
```

### Sorting Options

**By relevance** (default):
- Google's algorithm determines relevance
- Considers citations, author reputation, publication venue
- Generally good for most searches

**By date**:
- Most recent papers first
- Good for fast-moving fields
- May miss highly cited older papers
- Click "Sort by date" in interface

**By citation count** (via script):
```bash
python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "transformers" \
  --sort-by citations \
  --limit 50
```

### Language Filtering

**In interface**:
- Settings → Languages
- Select preferred languages

**Default**: English and papers with English abstracts

## Search Strategies

### Finding Seminal Papers

Identify highly influential papers in a field:

1. **Search by topic** with broad terms
2. **Sort by citations** (most cited first)
3. **Look for review articles** for comprehensive overviews
4. **Check publication dates** for foundational vs recent work

**Example**:
```
"generative adversarial networks"
# Sort by citations
# Top results: original GAN paper (Goodfellow et al., 2014), key variants
```

### Finding Recent Work

Stay current with latest research:

1. **Search by topic**
2. **Filter to recent years** (last 1-2 years)
3. **Sort by date** for newest first
4. **Set up alerts** for ongoing tracking

**Example**:
```bash
python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "AlphaFold protein structure" \
  --year-start 2023 \
  --year-end 2024 \
  --limit 50
```

### Finding Review Articles

Get comprehensive overviews of a field:

```
intitle:review "machine learning"
"systematic review" CRISPR
intitle:survey "natural language processing"
```

**Indicators**:
- "review", "survey", "perspective" in title
- Often highly cited
- Published in review journals (Nature Reviews, Trends, etc.)
- Comprehensive reference lists

### Citation Chain Search

**Forward citations** (papers citing a key paper):
1. Find seminal paper
2. Click "Cited by X"
3. See all papers that cite it
4. Identify how field has developed

**Backward citations** (references in a key paper):
1. Find recent review or important paper
2. Check its reference list
3. Identify foundational work
4. Trace development of ideas

**Example workflow**:
```
# Find original transformer paper
"Attention is all you need" author:Vaswani

# Check "Cited by 120,000+"
# See evolution: BERT, GPT, T5, etc.

# Check references in original paper
# Find RNN, LSTM, attention mechanism origins
```

### Comprehensive Literature Search

For thorough coverage (e.g., systematic reviews):

1. **Generate synonym list**:
   - Main terms + alternatives
   - Acronyms + spelled out
   - US vs UK spelling

2. **Use OR operators**:
   ```
   ("machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural networks")
   ```

3. **Combine multiple concepts**:
   ```
   ("machine learning" OR "deep learning") ("drug discovery" OR "drug development")
   ```

4. **Search without date filters** initially:
   - Get total landscape
   - Filter later if too many results

5. **Export results** for systematic analysis:
   ```bash
   python scripts/search_google_scholar.py \
     '"machine learning" OR "deep learning" drug discovery' \
     --limit 500 \
     --output comprehensive_search.json
   ```

## Extracting Citation Information

### From Google Scholar Results Page

Each result shows:
- **Title**: Paper title (linked to full text if available)
- **Authors**: Author list (often truncated)
- **Source**: Journal/conference, year, publisher
- **Cited by**: Number of citations + link to citing papers
- **Related articles**: Link to similar papers
- **All versions**: Different versions of the same paper

### Export Options

**Manual export**:
1. Click "Cite" under paper
2. Select BibTeX format
3. Copy citation

**Limitations**:
- One paper at a time
- Manual process
- Time-consuming for many papers

**Automated export** (using script):
```bash
# Search and export to BibTeX
python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "quantum computing" \
  --limit 50 \
  --format bibtex \
  --output quantum_papers.bib
```

### Metadata Available

From Google Scholar you can typically extract:
- Title
- Authors (may be incomplete)
- Year
- Source (journal/conference)
- Citation count
- Link to full text (when available)
- Link to PDF (when available)

**Note**: Metadata quality varies:
- Some fields may be missing
- Author names may be incomplete
- Need to verify with DOI lookup for accuracy

## Rate Limiting and Access

### Rate Limits

Google Scholar has rate limiting to prevent automated scraping:

**Symptoms of rate limiting**:
- CAPTCHA challenges
- Temporary IP blocks
- 429 "Too Many Requests" errors

**Best practices**:
1. **Add delays between requests**: 2-5 seconds minimum
2. **Limit query volume**: Don't search hundreds of queries rapidly
3. **Use scholarly library**: Handles rate limiting automatically
4. **Rotate User-Agents**: Appear as different browsers
5. **Consider proxies**: For large-scale searches (use ethically)

**In our scripts**:
```python
# Automatic rate limiting built in
time.sleep(random.uniform(3, 7))  # Random delay 3-7 seconds
```

### Ethical Considerations

**DO**:
- Respect rate limits
- Use reasonable delays
- Cache results (don't re-query)
- Use official APIs when available
- Attribute data properly

**DON'T**:
- Scrape aggressively
- Use multiple IPs to bypass limits
- Violate terms of service
- Burden servers unnecessarily
- Use data commercially without permission

### Institutional Access

**Benefits of institutional access**:
- Access to full-text PDFs through library subscriptions
- Better download capabilities
- Integration with library systems
- Link resolver to full text

**Setup**:
- Google Scholar → Settings → Library links
- Add your institution
- Links appear in search results

## Tips and Best Practices

### Search Optimization

1. **Start simple, then refine**:
   ```
   # Too specific initially
   intitle:"deep learning" intitle:review source:Nature 2023..2024
   
   # Better approach
   deep learning review
   # Review results
   # Add intitle:, source:, year filters as needed
   ```

2. **Use multiple search strategies**:
   - Keyword search
   - Author search for known experts
   - Citation chaining from key papers
   - Source search in top journals

3. **Check spelling and variations**:
   - Color vs colour
   - Optimization vs optimisation
   - Tumor vs tumour
   - Try common misspellings if few results

4. **Combine operators strategically**:
   ```
   # Good combination
   author:Church intitle:"synthetic biology" 2015..2024
   
   # Find reviews by specific author on topic in recent years
   ```

### Result Evaluation

1. **Check citation counts**:
   - High citations indicate influence
   - Recent papers may have low citations but be important
   - Citation counts vary by field

2. **Verify publication venue**:
   - Peer-reviewed journals vs preprints
   - Conference proceedings
   - Book chapters
   - Technical reports

3. **Check for full text access**:
   - [PDF] link on right side
   - "All X versions" may have open access version
   - Check institutional access
   - Try author's website or ResearchGate

4. **Look for review articles**:
   - Comprehensive overviews
   - Good starting point for new topics
   - Extensive reference lists

### Managing Results

1. **Use citation manager integration**:
   - Export to BibTeX
   - Import to Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote
   - Maintain organized library

2. **Set up alerts** for ongoing research:
   - Google Scholar → Alerts
   - Get emails for new papers matching query
   - Track specific authors or topics

3. **Create collections**:
   - Save papers to Google Scholar Library
   - Organize by project or topic
   - Add labels and notes

4. **Export systematically**:
   ```bash
   # Save search results for later analysis
   python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "your topic" \
     --output topic_papers.json
   
   # Can re-process later without re-searching
   python scripts/extract_metadata.py \
     --input topic_papers.json \
     --output topic_refs.bib
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

### Boolean Logic Combinations

Combine multiple operators for precise searches:

```
# Highly cited reviews on specific topic by known authors
intitle:review "machine learning" ("drug discovery" OR "drug development")
author:Horvath OR author:Bengio 2020..2024

# Method papers excluding reviews
intitle:method "protein folding" -review -survey

# Papers in top journals only
("Nature" OR "Science" OR "Cell") CRISPR 2022..2024
```

### Finding Open Access Papers

```
# Search with generic terms
machine learning

# Filter by "All versions" which often includes preprints
# Look for green [PDF] links (often open access)
# Check arXiv, bioRxiv versions
```

**In script**:
```bash
python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "topic" \
  --open-access-only \
  --output open_access_papers.json
```

### Tracking Research Impact

**For a specific paper**:
1. Find the paper
2. Click "Cited by X"
3. Analyze citing papers:
   - How is it being used?
   - What fields cite it?
   - Recent vs older citations?

**For an author**:
1. Search `author:LastName`
2. Check h-index and i10-index
3. View citation history graph
4. Identify most influential papers

**For a topic**:
1. Search topic
2. Sort by citations
3. Identify seminal papers (highly cited, older)
4. Check recent highly-cited papers (emerging important work)

### Finding Preprints and Early Work

```
# arXiv papers
source:arxiv "deep learning"

# bioRxiv papers
source:biorxiv CRISPR

# All preprint servers
("arxiv" OR "biorxiv" OR "medrxiv") your topic
```

**Note**: Preprints are not peer-reviewed. Always check if published version exists.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Too Many Results

**Problem**: Search returns 100,000+ results, overwhelming.

**Solutions**:
1. Add more specific terms
2. Use `intitle:` to search only titles
3. Filter by recent years
4. Add exclusions (e.g., `-review`)
5. Search within specific journals

### Too Few Results

**Problem**: Search returns 0-10 results, suspiciously few.

**Solutions**:
1. Remove restrictive operators
2. Try synonyms and related terms
3. Check spelling
4. Broaden year range
5. Use OR for alternative terms

### Irrelevant Results

**Problem**: Results don't match intent.

**Solutions**:
1. Use exact phrases with quotes
2. Add more specific context terms
3. Use `intitle:` for title-only search
4. Exclude common irrelevant terms
5. Combine multiple specific terms

### CAPTCHA or Rate Limiting

**Problem**: Google Scholar shows CAPTCHA or blocks access.

**Solutions**:
1. Wait several minutes before continuing
2. Reduce query frequency
3. Use longer delays in scripts (5-10 seconds)
4. Switch to different IP/network
5. Consider using institutional access

### Missing Metadata

**Problem**: Author names, year, or venue missing from results.

**Solutions**:
1. Click through to see full details
2. Check "All versions" for better metadata
3. Look up by DOI if available
4. Extract metadata from CrossRef/PubMed instead
5. Manually verify from paper PDF

### Duplicate Results

**Problem**: Same paper appears multiple times.

**Solutions**:
1. Click "All X versions" to see consolidated view
2. Choose version with best metadata
3. Use deduplication in post-processing:
   ```bash
   python scripts/format_bibtex.py results.bib \
     --deduplicate \
     --output clean_results.bib
   ```

## Integration with Scripts

### search_google_scholar.py Usage

**Basic search**:
```bash
python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "machine learning drug discovery"
```

# Create file with search queries (queries.txt)
# One query per line

# Search each query
while read query; do
  python scripts/search_google_scholar.py "$query" \
    --limit 50 \
    --output "${query// /_}.json"
  sleep 10  # Delay between queries
done < queries.txt
```
