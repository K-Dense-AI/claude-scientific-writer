# Field-Specific Language and Terminology

> Reference guide for discipline-specific writing conventions
> Load this file when adapting writing for specific scientific fields

## Overview

Adapt language, terminology, and conventions to match the specific scientific discipline. Each field has established vocabulary, preferred phrasings, and domain-specific conventions that signal expertise and ensure clarity for the target audience.

**Identify Field-Specific Linguistic Conventions:**
- Review terminology used in recent high-impact papers in the target journal
- Note field-specific abbreviations, units, and notation systems
- Identify preferred terms (e.g., "participants" vs. "subjects," "compound" vs. "drug," "specimens" vs. "samples")
- Observe how methods, organisms, or techniques are typically described

## Biomedical and Clinical Sciences

- Use precise anatomical and clinical terminology (e.g., "myocardial infarction" not "heart attack" in formal writing)
- Follow standardized disease nomenclature (ICD, DSM, SNOMED-CT)
- Specify drug names using generic names first, brand names in parentheses if needed
- Use "patients" for clinical studies, "participants" for community-based research
- Follow Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature for genetic variants
- Report lab values with standard units (SI units in most international journals)

## Molecular Biology and Genetics

- Use italics for gene symbols (e.g., *TP53*), regular font for proteins (e.g., p53)
- Follow species-specific gene nomenclature (uppercase for human: *BRCA1*; sentence case for mouse: *Brca1*)
- Specify organism names in full at first mention, then use accepted abbreviations (e.g., *Escherichia coli*, then *E. coli*)
- Use standard genetic notation (e.g., +/+, +/-, -/- for genotypes)
- Employ established terminology for molecular techniques (e.g., "quantitative PCR" or "qPCR," not "real-time PCR")

## Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences

- Follow IUPAC nomenclature for chemical compounds
- Use systematic names for novel compounds, common names for well-known substances
- Specify chemical structures using standard notation (e.g., SMILES, InChI for databases)
- Report concentrations with appropriate units (mM, μM, nM, or % w/v, v/v)
- Describe synthesis routes using accepted reaction nomenclature
- Use terms like "bioavailability," "pharmacokinetics," "IC50" consistently with field definitions

## Ecology and Environmental Sciences

- Use binomial nomenclature for species (italicized: *Homo sapiens*)
- Specify taxonomic authorities at first species mention when relevant
- Employ standardized habitat and ecosystem classifications
- Use consistent terminology for ecological metrics (e.g., "species richness," "Shannon diversity index")
- Describe sampling methods with field-standard terms (e.g., "transect," "quadrat," "mark-recapture")

## Physics and Engineering

- Follow SI units consistently unless field conventions dictate otherwise
- Use standard notation for physical quantities (scalars vs. vectors, tensors)
- Employ established terminology for phenomena (e.g., "quantum entanglement," "laminar flow")
- Specify equipment with model numbers and manufacturers when relevant
- Use mathematical notation consistent with field standards (e.g., ℏ for reduced Planck constant)

## Neuroscience

- Use standardized brain region nomenclature (e.g., refer to atlases like Allen Brain Atlas)
- Specify coordinates for brain regions using established stereotaxic systems
- Follow conventions for neural terminology (e.g., "action potential" not "spike" in formal writing)
- Use "neural activity," "neuronal firing," "brain activation" appropriately based on measurement method
- Describe recording techniques with proper specificity (e.g., "whole-cell patch clamp," "extracellular recording")

## Social and Behavioral Sciences

- Use person-first language when appropriate (e.g., "people with schizophrenia" not "schizophrenics")
- Employ standardized psychological constructs and validated assessment names
- Follow APA guidelines for reducing bias in language
- Specify theoretical frameworks using established terminology
- Use "participants" rather than "subjects" for human research

## General Principles

### Match Audience Expertise

- For specialized journals: Use field-specific terminology freely, define only highly specialized or novel terms
- For broad-impact journals (e.g., *Nature*, *Science*): Define more technical terms, provide context for specialized concepts
- For interdisciplinary audiences: Balance precision with accessibility, define terms at first use

### Define Technical Terms Strategically

- Define abbreviations at first use: "messenger RNA (mRNA)"
- Provide brief explanations for specialized techniques when writing for broader audiences
- Avoid over-defining terms well-known to the target audience (signals unfamiliarity with field)
- Create a glossary if numerous specialized terms are unavoidable

### Maintain Consistency

- Use the same term for the same concept throughout (don't alternate between "medication," "drug," and "pharmaceutical")
- Follow a consistent system for abbreviations (decide on "PCR" or "polymerase chain reaction" after first definition)
- Apply the same nomenclature system throughout (especially for genes, species, chemicals)

### Avoid Field Mixing Errors

- Don't use clinical terminology for basic science (e.g., don't call mice "patients")
- Avoid colloquialisms or overly general terms in place of precise field terminology
- Don't import terminology from adjacent fields without ensuring proper usage

### Verify Terminology Usage

- Consult field-specific style guides and nomenclature resources
- Check how terms are used in recent papers from the target journal
- Use domain-specific databases and ontologies (e.g., Gene Ontology, MeSH terms)
- When uncertain, cite a key reference that establishes terminology
