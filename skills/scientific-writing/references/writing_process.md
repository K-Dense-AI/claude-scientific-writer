# Writing Process: From Outline to Full Paragraphs

## Critical Rule

**Always write in full paragraphs, never submit bullet points in scientific papers.**

Scientific papers must be written in complete, flowing prose. Use this two-stage approach for effective writing.

## Stage 1: Create Section Outlines with Key Points

When starting a new section:

1. Use the research-lookup skill to gather relevant literature and data
2. Create a structured outline with bullet points marking:
   - Main arguments or findings to present
   - Key studies to cite
   - Data points and statistics to include
   - Logical flow and organization
3. These bullet points serve as scaffolding—they are NOT the final manuscript

### Example Outline (Introduction section)

```
- Background: AI in drug discovery gaining traction
  * Cite recent reviews (Smith 2023, Jones 2024)
  * Traditional methods are slow and expensive
- Gap: Limited application to rare diseases
  * Only 2 prior studies (Lee 2022, Chen 2023)
  * Small datasets remain a challenge
- Our approach: Transfer learning from common diseases
  * Novel architecture combining X and Y
- Study objectives: Validate on 3 rare disease datasets
```

## Stage 2: Convert Key Points to Full Paragraphs

Once the outline is complete, expand each bullet point into proper prose:

1. **Transform bullet points into complete sentences** with subjects, verbs, and objects
2. **Add transitions** between sentences and ideas (however, moreover, in contrast, subsequently)
3. **Integrate citations naturally** within sentences, not as lists
4. **Expand with context and explanation** that bullet points omit
5. **Ensure logical flow** from one sentence to the next within each paragraph
6. **Vary sentence structure** to maintain reader engagement

### Example Conversion to Prose

```
Artificial intelligence approaches have gained significant traction in drug discovery
pipelines over the past decade (Smith, 2023; Jones, 2024). While these computational
methods show promise for accelerating the identification of therapeutic candidates,
traditional experimental approaches remain slow and resource-intensive, often requiring
years of laboratory work and substantial financial investment. However, the application
of AI to rare diseases has been limited, with only two prior studies demonstrating
proof-of-concept results (Lee, 2022; Chen, 2023). The primary obstacle has been the
scarcity of training data for conditions affecting small patient populations.

To address this challenge, we developed a transfer learning approach that leverages
knowledge from well-characterized common diseases to predict therapeutic targets for
rare conditions. Our novel neural architecture combines convolutional layers for
molecular feature extraction with attention mechanisms for protein-ligand interaction
modeling. The objective of this study was to validate our approach across three
independent rare disease datasets, assessing both predictive accuracy and biological
interpretability of the results.

## Key Differences: Outlines vs Final Text

| Outline (Planning Stage) | Final Manuscript |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Bullet points and fragments | Complete sentences and paragraphs |
| Telegraphic notes | Full explanations with context |
| List of citations | Citations integrated into prose |
| Abbreviated ideas | Developed arguments with transitions |
| For your eyes only | For publication and peer review |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Never** leave bullet points in the final manuscript
- **Never** submit lists where paragraphs should be
- **Don't** use numbered or bulleted lists in Results or Discussion sections (except for specific cases like study hypotheses or inclusion criteria)
- **Don't** write sentence fragments or incomplete thoughts
- **Do** use occasional lists only in Methods (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria, materials lists)
- **Do** ensure every section flows as connected prose
- **Do** read paragraphs aloud to check for natural flow

---

## When Lists ARE Acceptable (Limited Cases)

Lists may appear in scientific papers only in specific contexts:

- **Methods**: Inclusion/exclusion criteria, materials and reagents, participant characteristics
- **Supplementary Materials**: Extended protocols, equipment lists, detailed parameters
- **Never in**: Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, Conclusions

---

## Abstract Format Rule

- **NEVER** use labeled sections (Background:, Methods:, Results:, Conclusions:)
- **ALWAYS** write as flowing paragraph(s) with natural transitions
- Exception: Only use structured format if journal explicitly requires it in author guidelines

---

## Integration with Research Lookup

The research-lookup skill is essential for Stage 1 (creating outlines):

1. Search for relevant papers using research-lookup
2. Extract key findings, methods, and data
3. Organize findings as bullet points in your outline
4. Then convert the outline to full paragraphs in Stage 2

This two-stage process ensures you:

- Gather and organize information systematically
- Create logical structure before writing
- Produce polished, publication-ready prose
- Maintain focus on the narrative flow
